Create a folder and place the 3 files in the folder. 
Visit the path and it should open index.php resenting you with a form to start adding your supplier entries.
Entries are automatically listed below the form.
process.php sends your entries to the text file which inturn is sent back to index.php so you can view them.

You could also load data.txt into your preferred profgram as the data is stored in json, eg excel can read this data.
